# e2e/lima.sh — Linux/docker verification path for the StatsHouse e2e harness.
#
# Spins up a lima VM (Ubuntu, rootful Docker), installs a Go toolchain + C
# compiler in the guest, cross-compiles the harness binary on the Mac for
# linux/arm64, then runs it inside the VM over the same-path mounted checkout.
# Inside the VM the harness auto-detects docker and runs the FULL suite
# unchanged — every assertion path is byte-for-byte identical to `go run ./e2e`
# on the Mac (apple/container).
#
# Assumes Apple silicon: created without --arch, the guest is linux/arm64 (an
# Intel Mac would produce an x86_64 guest that cannot exec the harness binary).
#
# Usage:
#   bash e2e/lima.sh                 # full suite, all three clients, fresh stack
#   bash e2e/lima.sh --keep          # leave the stack up; curl the api from the Mac
#   bash e2e/lima.sh --client=go     # any harness flag passes through verbatim
#
# Idempotent — create-once, run-many:
#   • The VM is created on first run (downloads the Ubuntu image, ~1 GB) and
#     reused on every later run; `limactl start` is a no-op when already running.
#   • The guest toolchain (Go + build-essential) is installed only if missing.
#   • The harness binary is rebuilt by `go build` (incremental) — a no-change
#     rerun is near-instant.
#   • Re-running after a --keep run prunes the kept stack: the harness removes
#     every e2e-* container BEFORE it re-publishes the api port, so there is no
#     "port already in use" collision, then starts a fresh stack.
#
# Design choices (documented per "document the choice in the header"):
#
#   • template:docker-rootful — the spec wrote `template://docker`, and Lima's
#     `docker` template does install Docker, but it installs it ROOTLESS. Rootless
#     Docker's bridge network lives in a private network namespace that the lima
#     user's main namespace (where the harness process runs) cannot route to:
#     a container can be UP and listening on 0.0.0.0:2442 yet a `nc -vz
#     <container-ip> 2442` from the VM host still fails. The harness dials
#     container IPs for EVERY readiness probe and inter-service wire (
#     "all service wiring is by IP"), so rootless breaks it with no path-neutral
#     harness fix. `docker-rootful` runs dockerd as a system service whose bridge
#     sits in the VM's main network namespace, so container IPs ARE reachable
#     from the host — identical to apple/container and to a real Linux box (which
#     is what the spec's "On a real Linux box: plain `go run ./e2e`" assumes, a
#     box that runs rootful Docker by default). The template grants the lima user
#     access to the Docker socket (SocketUser override), so `docker` needs no
#     sudo and auto-detection picks it without --runtime. This is the one
#     documented deviation from the spec's literal `template://docker`; Lima also
#     prints a deprecation hint for the `//` URL form, so the v2 canonical
#     `template:` prefix is used.
#
#   • Go toolchain in the GUEST. The harness drives `go build` for the four
#     daemons (build.go); that needs `go` on the guest PATH. The harness BINARY
#     itself is cross-compiled on the Mac (known-good toolchain) and only the
#     four daemons are built in the guest. build-essential covers the metadata
#     daemon's CGO (sqlite amalgamation). Rejected alternative: cross-compiling
#     the daemons on the Mac too and sharing them over the mount — the daemon
#     cache lives under the guest $HOME, which differs from the Mac home, so it
#     could not be pre-populated over the mount without harness changes (which
#     are forbidden as path-specific behavior).
#
#   • Guest $HOME differs from the Mac. Lima v2 sets it to /home/<user>.guest
#     (NOT the Mac home), so ~/.cache/statshouse-e2e (daemon + client build
#     caches) is a fresh tree the first VM run populates: client repos re-clone
#     (the guest has NAT network) and the daemons rebuild. Host and guest caches
#     never mix, so a Mac run and a VM run cannot corrupt each other's cache.
#
#   • Guest published ports auto-forward to 127.0.0.1 on the Mac via Lima's
#     built-in dynamic port forwarding, so while --keep is set a `curl
#     http://127.0.0.1:10888/...` from the Mac reaches the api container.
